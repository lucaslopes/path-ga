# Path GA
> Find a path to the target using Genetic Algorithm

In a 1000x1000 canvas there's a wall on the middle, and only two tiny gaps.
The objective is to go from the top left corner to the lower rifht corner.

The demonstration is runing [here](https://lucaslopes.github.io/path-ga/)

It takes about 7 generations to pass through gap, and another 5 generations to arrive on the target.
